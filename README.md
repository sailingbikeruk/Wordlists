# Wordlists

Wordlists for Hashcat and similar tools

---------------------------------------

I have been creating wordlists for many years and have frequently lost them or had to delete them due to space issues or even just forgot where I put them. This is my online repository for saving any new ones as I create them so I don't have to duplicate this work any more.

If they are of use to you feel free to download. If you want to pull and keep your own copy, help yourself. I suspect there are much better ones out there.
